Based on the information provided in the data/cv-input.xlsx document, builds a polished CV/Resume in HTML and PDF format.

When adding in your information into the Excel document, do not modify the headers of the sheets neither the sheet names.

The Configuration and Overview sheets only allow information to be changed there and thus no additional information can be inputted. If doing so, the process will fail.

For the remainder of the sheets, add as many rows of information you require abiding by the schema of the sheet.

To render PDF documents you will need to install the wkhtmltopdf toolkit.
